### Study Highlights
1. To evaluate the performance of the data-mining approach in detecting adverse drug reaction (ADR) signals, 
   we created a global gold standard consisting of 92 positive and 88 negative drug–event pairs based on clinical evidence. 

2. Association rule mining on administrative claims data for ADR signal detection has the potential to serve as a complementary tool 
   for existing pharmacovigilance strategies.
